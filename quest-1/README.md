# ⛴️ Quest 1 - Mint a Pirate Ship NFT

📘 Write the code to mint yourself an NFT that will represent your pirate ship.

Throughout the bootcamp, we’ll customize this NFT, use it to build other things, and ultimately
you’ll battle other NFTs on the high seas.

## Tech stack used

- uses TypeScript and NodeJS
- yarn (as the package manager)

## Set up locally

1. Clone this repo to your local system
2. Install the packages via `yarn install`
3. Copy rename the `example.env` file to be named `.env`
4. Update the `RPC_URL` variable to be the cluster URL of a supporting RPC provider

If you have the Solana CLI installed locally: update the `LOCAL_PAYER_JSON_ABSPATH` environment
variable to be the **_absolute path_** of your local testing wallet keypair JSON file.

## Recommended flow to explore this repo

After setting up locally, I recommend exploring the code of the following files (in order):

- [`1.simpleTransaction.ts`](./scripts/1.simpleTransaction.ts)
- [`2.complexTransaction.ts`](./scripts/2.complexTransaction.ts)
- [`3.createTokenWithMetadata.ts`](./scripts/3.createTokenWithMetadata.ts)
- [`4.mintTokens.ts`](./scripts/4.mintTokens.ts)
- [`5.updateMetadata.ts`](./scripts/5.updateMetadata.ts)
- [`6.createNFTs.ts`](./scripts/6.createNFTs.ts)

After reviewing the code in each of these scripts, try running each in order.

> **Note:** Running each of these scripts may save some various bits of data to a `.local_keys`
> folder within this repo for use by the other scripts later in this ordered list. Therefore,
> running them in a different order may result in them not working as written/desired. You have been
> warned :)

### Running the included Scripts

Once set up locally, you will be able to run the scripts included within this repo:

```
